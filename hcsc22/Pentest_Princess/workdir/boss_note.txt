quick heads-up on wilfred.
since we fired him last week, i need someone to look at how his db restoration progress was coming along.
The IT folks changed the db name to better reflect our new company name (had to re-brand everything for our customers will once again trust us after that cat messed up the database)
so.. our new name is "awesome-corp" from now on.

hurry up! can't wait to move this sandbox DB into prod.
