# Where to meet that hosted by me?

Hmmm ... Where can we meet with our Team to Talk in
high quality, watch a video together and share files?
Discord? Mmm, ooh no! Small file limit and low quality.
Find another solution! Ahh, yes! It called TT, a
conference system, made by a person in Denmark. Oh,
and I self-host it since ten years so I know everything
about it! Get ready your SySadmin (Hype) skils!
