# F-corp APT

The F-Corp junior digital forensics team found the attached suspicious file on one of the strictly protected servers containing delicate information. They fear that the program could be a targeted attack, which might even be a component of a larger malware infection chain. They haven't been able to determine the file's real function. It's up to you from here whether you uncover its real function and the secret message.

Flag format: QC23{...}
