# Challenge

Upon modifying an open-source library for our company's needs for the super secret interworkings the developer caught a ransom that corrupted all data present on their developer PC. All files produced by this library were lost. The only thing we have now is a dump of all variable set calls since this was successfully restored from the RAM. Think of this dump like placing printf calls at every single variable update. Altough the developer was so desperate that he quit the other day, I trust you to find this open-source library and recover the original file. All I know is that it was written in C. Probably a decoder? How would I know, I am just a CEO... The company awaits for a hero!
