# Music improves productivity.

Hmm, I always listen music when use my computer with my headset. It is important part of my life. I like internet radio to get new musics, and I like to add them to my local library in MP3.
**I need to manage my music. Place a special character / or : to filename! Possible? Ohh, wait!**
