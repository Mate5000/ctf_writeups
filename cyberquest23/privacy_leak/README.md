# Privacy leak

Did you join our Discord server already? If not, head over to this link, since we announce important news and it's easier to get help as well over there: https://discord.honeylab.hu/ Now, we put a flag somewhere there, but flags are just like spiders. They like to hide in the shadows... Do you know Discord enough to find what you are looking for? Not? Well, well... The almighty search engine might be your friend. \u2728

> Remarks from the author:
> * the flag has nothing to do with the server members, please respect their privacy and don't bother looking there - OSINT isn't required for this challenge

**Flag format**: `cq23{...}`

*By MJ - Contact me on Discord with the same nick if you think you found an issue or open a ticket in #help-tickets.*
